# Developer Utilities

This repository contains small, reusable helpers for working with the API.

Each helper is:
- Standalone
- Minimal
- Dependency-free (where possible)
- Designed for developers building on top of the API

## Philosophy

These utilities are meant to:
- Reduce boilerplate
- Improve developer experience
- Be easy to copy into any project
- Work independently of frameworks (Node, Next, Bun, etc.)

---
